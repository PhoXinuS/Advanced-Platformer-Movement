# Advanced-Platformer-Movement
 Advanced momvement script allowing such behaviours as climbing, hanging over the edges, sliding and crawling.  
 Most of its behaviour is based on a standarad Raycast2D detecting state in which the player is currently.  
 This allows to have a low impact on the performance and detect correctly the position of a player without usage of trigger boxes to i.e. grab an edge.  
   
 Setting up the player model to be compatible needs some work but it could be automated in the future.
